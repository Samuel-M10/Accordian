# Accordion App

An interactive accordion app built using Vite, React, and JavaScript. This app supports two modes of operation:

1. **Single Opening**: Only one section can be open at a time. When a new section is opened, the previously opened section closes automatically.
2. **Multiple Opening**: Multiple sections can be opened simultaneously.

## Features

- **Single Opening Mode**: Ensures that only one accordion item is open at any given time.
- **Multiple Opening Mode**: Allows multiple accordion items to be opened at once.
- Responsive and mobile-friendly design.
- Easy-to-understand implementation using React and Vite.

## Usage

The app includes an accordion component that can be toggled by clicking the header of any section.

- **Single Opening**: Only one section can be open at a time. If a section is open and you click on another section, the previous section will close, and the new one will open.
- **Multiple Opening**: You can click on any number of sections to open them simultaneously, without affecting others.
